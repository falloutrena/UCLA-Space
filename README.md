# UCLA Coding Bootcamp Project #2 - UCLA Space

In this project, we developed a social media website for students of the coding bootcamp to sign up to create a profile, in order to make posts related to coding.

## User Story

As a UCLA coding bootcamp student, I want to create a social media profile, make posts, and reply to others' posts so that we can collaborate and help each other build our coding skills.
